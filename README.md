## Summary

In conclusion, the “silver tsunami” will have a large impact on Pewlett Hackard, which makes it more imperative to take steps to ease through it.  A total number of 90,398 roles will need to be filled as people retire. There’s also a staggeringly low number of retirement-ready employees who qualify for a mentorship program, which is 1,549, or roughly 1.7% of those retiring.  A way you could provide more insight into employees who are retiring is you could make a table sorted by when people are planning on retiring. This would help not only for the current year’s retirees, but also future retirees as well. Another step that would possibly give better results would be a wider range of people close to retirement who could be enrolled into the mentor program. Given the lack of employees who currently could qualify, it would be advantageous to add more to the pool of people eligible for the membership program.
